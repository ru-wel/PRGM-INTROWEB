00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.200
Cascading Style Sheets, or CSS, is a style

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.900
sheet language famous for making

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.000
websites look pretty.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.100
By default, a browser will render

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.700
HTML as a boring black and white document.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.650
CSS allows you to describe the presentation

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.050
of this markup by modifying the size,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.150
color, positioning, and layout of HTML elements.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.880
It was first released in 1996 and evolved

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.440
into CSS 3 by 1999.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.240
The language continues to evolve to this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:27.640
day with new features, but there

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.960
will never be a CSS 4, just updates

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.280
to the existing language.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.840
The typical CSS rule starts with a selector

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.800
that can be matched to an element in the HTML document.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.320
You then use braces to create a declaration

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.240
block that contain properties that change

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.600
the appearance of that element.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.680
This is known as a CSS rule.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.640
But the tricky thing is that style sheets cascade.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.320
A style sheet might contain multiple

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.200
rules that apply to the same element.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.100
This creates a hierarchy and rules

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.400
that are more specific will

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.000
overwrite the rules of their parents.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.920
In other words, the order of your CSS rules matter.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.560
In addition, some elements will

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.120
inherit the styles of their parent,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.400
but others will not.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.800
Ultimately, the browser uses the concepts

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.480
of cascade, specificity and inheritance

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.880
to control which styles are applied to an element.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.000
To get started, open up a style tag

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.600
in any HTML document.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.560
A selector can target all HTML

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.520
elements of a certain type, multiple

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.000
related elements with a custom

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.280
class, or a single element with an ID.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.320
Now think of every HTML element like a box.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.680
The content is in the middle,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.240
followed by padding, border, and a margin.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.280
The amount of real estate used by every

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.840
area in the box can be customized by defining

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.800
properties like padding and margin.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.680
They can take explicit pixel values

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.120
or responsive values that are

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.640
relative to the parent element or a percentage

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.760
of the viewport itself.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.840
Now these boxes will bump into each other

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.720
to make up a web page, but you can use

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.600
tools like flex layout and grid

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.200
layout to control how they flow

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.880
together in a sophisticated way.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It can also detect user interaction

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.680
with pseudo selectors like hover.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.760
CSS also makes it possible to add

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.750
logic to your code with variables or custom properties

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
and by making media queries that can apply styles conditionally

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.250
based on the size or type of device.

00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:08.450
And it can even handle complex animations

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.450
with transitions and keyframes.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.150
