00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.400
Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.440
is a language that defines the structure

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.040
of content on a web page.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.880
Development started in 1989 at CERN

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.600
by Tim Berners Lee, who had just

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.880
invented the world's first web

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.520
browser, World Wide Web, the origin of WWW.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.360
But he needed a publishing language

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.760
to display content within it.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.240
So he chose a syntax based on the 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.000
Standard Generalized Markup Language, which

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160
uses opening and closing tags to provide

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.120
meaning to otherwise unorganized

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.840
text like h for heading, p for paragraph,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.160
and most importantly, a for anchor

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.800
to link to a different web page.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.520
The language underwent many changes

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.120
during the initial rise of the Internet

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.200
and was standardized as HTML5 in 2008,

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.800
the version we know and love today.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.280
Modern HTML contains tags to handle

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.960
a variety of different media types

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.280
like video, audio, and canvas.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.160
To draw custom graphics on the fly.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.320
The typical HTML element starts with

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.000
an opening and closing tag.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.920
In the middle we have content, which

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.000
might be text or additional HTML

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.960
elements called children.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.400
The opening tag may also have one or

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.280
more attributes which are key value

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.200
pairs that can customize the appearance

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.720
or behavior of the element.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.400
To build your first web page, create

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.640
a file named index dot HTML.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.840
This file contains A hierarchy of nodes

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.400
based on the Document Object Model or DOM.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.800
A web page starts with an HTML tag

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.120
and has exactly two children, a head and a body.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.960
The head contains things that aren't

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.880
directly shown in the web page, like

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.240
a title or a meta tag to give the page a description.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.160
But notice how the meta element has no closing tag.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.000
Closing tags are generally optional.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.200
When an element is fully

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.040
self-contained, the body contains the actual UI.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.000
For the end user.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.720
We might start with an H1 heading

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.560
followed by a paragraph of content.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.800
To add an image we use an image tag,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520
which you'll notice is self closing.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.640
Then define the source attribute as

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.320
the file path to the image and you'll

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.600
want to give it an alt description

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.160
to make it accessible to robots and screen readers.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.760
What makes web pages revolutionary,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.560
though, is their ability to link to other

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.650
web pages on the information super highway.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.400
Use an anchor tag to create a link,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.300
then define the href attribute

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.350
as the webpage that you want to navigate to

00:02:05.355 --> 00:02:06.200
when clicked.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.200
HTML also provides structural tags

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.850
like division, or div.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.850
Which are often used to group elements together,

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.850
where they can be styled to represent complex UI elements

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.850
like navbars.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.150
When you're happy with your code,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.400
grab the full file path to the HTML file

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.300
and paste into any web browser.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.150
Congratulations, you just built your first website!

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.250
